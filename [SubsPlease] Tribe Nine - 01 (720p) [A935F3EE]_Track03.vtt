00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.810
Year 20XX, Neo Tokyo.

2
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.850
Fed up with society,

3
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:29.940
youngsters joined hands to
find their own place in the world--

4
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.240
they formed tribes.

5
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.910
However, group loyalty was so fierce
that conflicts arose between the tribes

6
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.620
of the many cities of Neo Tokyo.

7
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.170
Due to their threat to society,
the Neo Tokyo government

8
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.340
"Breaking News:
XB (Extreme Baseball) Law Implemented"

9
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.340
decreed tribe conflicts to be resolved
through Extreme Baseball--

10
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.800
nicknamed the "XB Law."

11
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.890
Their pride on the line,

12
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.650
youngsters poured their
hearts into the radical game.

13
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.330
"Episode 1: It Takes Guts"

14
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.940
Extreme Baseball, huh?

15
00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.030
Sounds fun! You just wait!
I'm gonna beat you!

16
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.550
You know how this goes.
Out with it already.

17
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.550
Haru! Pretend to get your wallet out,
and then we'll run!

18
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.680
O-Okay.

19
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.770
Hey, you!

20
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.850
Yasuhiro!

21
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.400
Whoa there! Looks like you got
betrayed by your friend, Haru.

22
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.200
But since we're so nice,
we'll let you off with your wallet.

23
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.570
Wh-What?

24
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.420
Your squeaky little voice is pissing off
my empty stomach.

25
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.750
Take this, freak!

26
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:56.880
Look out!

27
00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.430
He with you?!

28
00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:02.680
N-No!

29
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.890
Whatever! Get 'em!

30
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.970
Hey!

31
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.810
Shit! If only I wasn't starving...

32
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.770
You're in for a world of hurt!

33
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.700
I sent the punk flying!

34
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.080
Hey, you! I saw that!

35
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.630
Hit back! Don't just stand there!

36
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.250
The hell--?

37
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.710
Who's there?!

38
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.800
Who are you?!

39
00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.100
When people start stupid shit
in my home, it upsets me.

40
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.020
Your home? Who the hell
do you think you are?

41
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.150
Oh, shit!

42
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.570
Eh? What's your problem?

43
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.780
That's Shun Kamiya!

44
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.110
What?! Shun Kamiya?!

45
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.450
Oh? Am I that famous?

46
00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.990
Just the guy I'm looking for!

47
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.250
H-Hey!

48
00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.210
Is it fun to outnumber and pick on people?

49
00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.300
No, it's not.
It takes no guts, you lowlifes.

50
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.380
Who gives a shit?!

51
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.270
Hmph! You missed. Extreme Baseball's
star player ain't a big deal after all.

52
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.440
No, he didn't...

53
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.630
Just this once.

54
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.550
If you pull shit like
this again in Minato City...

55
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.430
It'll get ugly.

56
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.770
--Dammit!
--Shit!

57
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.100
Shun Kamiya! I challenge you!

58
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.690
Huh? Why? Who are you?

59
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.650
I'm Taiga, the world's best
tuna fisherman from abroad!

60
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:31.740
And once I beat you, I'll be the best
Extreme Baseball player there is!

61
00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.000
Um, uh... Wait!

62
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.370
Guys?!

63
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.890
You moron! You drank so much
yesterday, you should've known!

64
00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.110
Ugh, I feel sick! Help me, Arisugawa!

65
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.190
Not happening.

66
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.950
Here! One cup of hangover cure.

67
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.620
Stop it, Micchan.
The smell of it's making me sick.

68
00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.120
Coffee?

69
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.000
Coffee hangover.

70
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.580
When Shun has over three cups,
he suffers the next day.

71
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.750
Nekomaru! I'm in agony!

72
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.010
Hey, aren't you hurt?

73
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.130
Huh? S-Sorry!

74
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.970
What's your name?

75
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.970
Haru. Haru Shirokane.

76
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.140
Oh? Haru, huh? Nice name.

77
00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.730
Manami? Patch him up, too.

78
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.320
Sure thing!

79
00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.530
You're really well-built. What do you do?

80
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.110
Tuna fishing.

81
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.950
Fishing?! You, too?

82
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:56.240
No, absolutely not! I'm, uh...

83
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.620
How do I put it? A boring person.

84
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.500
That's not true.

85
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.920
Huh?

86
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.380
You thought I'd say that? Too bad.

87
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.470
You can put yourself down, but don't
expect others to lift you back up.

88
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.430
That's just plain arrogance.

89
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.150
Kamiya, you've said too much.

90
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.400
H-Hey!

91
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.780
So be it! Your name is Tuna!

92
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.860
And your name is Boring!

93
00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.860
--Eh?
--The hell--?!

94
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.660
There it is! Shun's wacky naming sense!

95
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:41.580
In that case,
I think I'm gonna call you Barf!

96
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.920
Nah, I think not.

97
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.250
No objections!

98
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.130
At least give me a proper title.

99
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.760
Coffee Barfer!

100
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.010
Back me up here, Boring.

101
00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.390
Wh-What? I-I'm not--!

102
00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.810
Quit your stuttering!
If you're gonna talk, talk!

103
00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.520
What were those reflexes back there?

104
00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.480
What reflexes?

105
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.570
You saw that attack and totally dodged it.

106
00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.650
Your eyes and agility were
somehow good enough to pull it off.

107
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:15.660
Yet you're putting yourself down?

108
00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:21.500
N-No! I got beat up!
Didn't you see me get smacked around?!

109
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.290
For crying out loud.

110
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.630
--Oh?
--Oh?

111
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.390
Um, Haru?

112
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:39.100
S-Sorry!

113
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.060
He's that kinda guy.

114
00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:42.730
I see!

115
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:44.310
--I see!
--I see!

116
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:47.110
I-I'm not! Really!

117
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:50.780
Oh. We've got a customer.

118
00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:57.160
Are you guys Minato Tribe?

119
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.120
Huh? Uh, yeah.

120
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.160
Here's my business card.

121
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.870
Um, thanks.

122
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.250
Shinagawa Tribe's leader, Yutaka Gotanda?

123
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:13.840
This is forgery.
Shinagawa's leader is Kitahama.

124
00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.760
Was. He's no longer with Shinagawa.

125
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.930
We've taken over the tribe.

126
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:26.810
I've heard about a crew using tons
of XB gear to rise to the top.

127
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:29.230
Spikes, gloves, bats...

128
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:35.070
According to XB Law,
none of them are prohibited.

129
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:39.530
What do you want?
We're not gonna buy your junk.

130
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.500
Oh, please! We're not here
to peddle our wares.

131
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.670
But if we use the gear we developed

132
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:53.550
and manage to beat Minato Tribe,
the top-ranked team in Extreme Baseball,

133
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:56.470
what an advertisement it would be.

134
00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.720
What are they talking about?

135
00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.640
Shh!

136
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:06.430
Today, we're here to invite you
to play Extreme Baseball.

137
00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:11.310
In other words, we challenge you.

138
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.270
Hmph! Get lost!

139
00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:17.740
If you refuse, we'll say
Minato Tribe chickened out.

140
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:19.570
Chickened out?!

141
00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:20.660
Fine.

142
00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:21.780
--Eh?!
--Kamiya!

143
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.490
I mean, it sounds fun to me.

144
00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:26.910
Tuna and Boring, you play.

145
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.250
Huh? Play?

146
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.170
In a game?! A game! Hell yeah!

147
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:32.880
Why me?

148
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.380
Hey! What gives, Kamiya?

149
00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:37.760
They can play in my place.

150
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.180
--Eh?!
--Eh?!

151
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.010
I'm a big ship in a small pond!

152
00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:43.180
T-Taiga!

153
00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:47.020
It's fine! It's fine! It'll all work out.

154
00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.940
You're kidding!

155
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.900
Let's get to it.

156
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.800
Whoa!

157
00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:30.770
Hop in!

158
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:40.950
Whoa, Taiga!

159
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.700
Yeah! Living the dream!

160
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.990
Huh? What's that?

161
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.290
A judge robot--an umpire for XB.

162
00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.750
Power, okay!

163
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.920
Hydraulics, okay!

164
00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.290
Safety, okay!

165
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:55.670
All okay!

166
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:57.250
Who are they?

167
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:01.050
Four in our lineup. They're quadruplets.

168
00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.640
Good! Bench open!

169
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:14.270
It transformed!

170
00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.440
This is Minato Tribe's mobile bench!

171
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.780
Hell yeah!

172
00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.530
Now then, let's play ball
and have some fun!

173
00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:30.250
Change. You can't play in those clothes.

174
00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:32.290
B-But, I'm not--!

175
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:36.000
Here. Also, you'll want these.

176
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.760
A badge transmitter and bracelet
glove--basic Extreme Baseball gear!

177
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.050
I can't! I've never played!

178
00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.800
Don't be such a wimp!

179
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.390
You know you can't without ever trying?

180
00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:52.930
But, what if we lose?

181
00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:54.190
Try your best!

182
00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.980
You're kidding!

183
00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:58.900
Is trying your best too much to ask?

184
00:12:58.900 --> 00:12:59.770
Huh?

185
00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:02.690
I think it's a wonderful thing.

186
00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.610
H-Hey!

187
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.830
Just leave it to Big Ship Taiga!

188
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.330
For now, just remember this one thing--

189
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.540
once you've got the ball, beat 'em up!

190
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.170
--Huh?!
--Seriously? That's awesome!

191
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:22.340
Be careful!
They'll try to beat you up, too!

192
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.760
Mita! Get us up and ready!

193
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.130
Got it!

194
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.850
What position are you, Arisugawa?

195
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.680
Huh? Me?

196
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.520
--Catcher!
--Eh?

197
00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.400
Saori is our playmaker.

198
00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.940
Playmaker?

199
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.820
She's mentally and physically strong.

200
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:49.570
She's the only one who can catch
Shun's pitches when he's serious.

201
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:52.790
Play ball!

202
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.800
Gotcha!

203
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:10.800
There! Fifty meters north of Block 3!

204
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.770
Beneath it! Moving to intercept!

205
00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.040
Stop! Taiga!

206
00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.120
You're going nowhere, pal!

207
00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:39.920
Idiot!

208
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.000
Shit! The hell is this?!

209
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.880
Violation! Violation! Rule violation!

210
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:50.090
I said, "once you've got the ball!"

211
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:53.350
It's against the rules
to fight without it!

212
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.350
A-All right! My bad!

213
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:00.310
Newbie's fault.

214
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:01.650
Yeah, the newbie.

215
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.270
Definitely the newbie.

216
00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.070
The newbie, for sure.

217
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:06.940
Shuddap already!

218
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:09.650
Haru hits next.

219
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.120
I can't! There's no way!

220
00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.330
If you won't, then I will. All right?

221
00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:16.580
S-Sure.

222
00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:20.710
Damn, you really are Boring.

223
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.380
If you don't stand in the batter's box,
you'll never win a fight.

224
00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.680
Not everyone in the world wants
to fight as much as you do.

225
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:36.060
Then keep sucking your thumb and
watch from the sidelines, Mega Boring.

226
00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.640
Your nickname leveled up.

227
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.940
C'mon! Bring it!

228
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:50.860
The straightforward type--their simple
thinking makes them easy to deal with!

229
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.990
Strike!

230
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:55.160
Oof!

231
00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.790
This ain't over!

232
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.000
Strike!

233
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.170
Too much power! Tone it down, Taiga!

234
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:07.840
Hell no! When you fish,
you gotta set the hook like a boss!

235
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.720
If you don't and it gets away, you lose!

236
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.180
This, too! Winning without
giving your all ain't a win!

237
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.810
Playing to not lose is for losers!

238
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.470
Wise words!

239
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.440
--Huh?
--He'll hit the next one.

240
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.360
Huh?!

241
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.660
Heave ho!

242
00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.920
What?! It's okay! Stop him at 1st!

243
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.480
Outta the way!

244
00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:12.570
Yeah! That's the power
of a tuna fisherman!

245
00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:18.660
Did you see the ocean, too?

246
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.950
You're up next, Boring.

247
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.830
What? No!

248
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:27.170
Trying your best isn't a bad thing.

249
00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:30.800
You have your own way of trying your best.

250
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.100
Keep the bat in front of me!
Keep the bat in front of me!

251
00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.430
Huh? My strong point?

252
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.770
Yup. You've got good eyes.

253
00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:51.690
You've gotta use 'em.
Don't close your eyes. Use both.

254
00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:56.200
Do that and you'll see
things you never did before.

255
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.740
What kind of stance is that?

256
00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:03.160
Let's scare him a little bit.

257
00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.870
Use both eyes! Use both eyes!

258
00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:10.920
--Look out!
--Hey! Dodge it!

259
00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:18.970
Run!

260
00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.890
Huh? Can I?

261
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:21.930
Go!

262
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.850
No way! I hit it?!

263
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.520
Sorry! An error caused it to freeze.

264
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.940
That's 'cuz you
outsourced it to save money!

265
00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:39.450
Forget about 2nd! Stop him at 1st!

266
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:48.460
No way! I'll die if I'm hit!

267
00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.090
I wanna give up and run! I'm scared!

268
00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:54.420
Don't close your eyes.

269
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:12.860
--Yeah!
--Woohoo!

270
00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:17.150
I got on base?! For real?!

271
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.200
Nice one, Boring!

272
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.700
Those two aren't half bad!

273
00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:22.910
Mm-hmm.

274
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.950
You knew from the start?

275
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:31.170
Who knows? Now then, it's time
to show the newbies how it's done.

276
00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.460
I'll handle the grounders.

277
00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:37.460
Don't worry. I won't let anyone else...

278
00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.260
Oh? It's Minato's big slugger.

279
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:47.930
If I knock out your one and only pitcher,
doesn't it mean that we win?

280
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.690
Do you honestly think you can?

281
00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:55.440
Easily.

282
00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:00.320
In that case, behold
my maximum-power pitching!

283
00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:07.950
The hell--?!

284
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.870
I'll activate mighty mode.

285
00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:17.300
Feast your eyes on Shinagawa Tribe's
latest XB Gear--Gungnir Alpha!

286
00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.970
It's packed with artificial muscles
totaling 50 horsepower!

287
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:28.390
And a high-speed plasma drum
that throws a ball at railgun speeds!

288
00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:30.560
Awesome! For real?!

289
00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.140
That's allowed?

290
00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.940
Apparently.

291
00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.960
What's wrong?
Too fast for your eyes to see?

292
00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:01.630
If you dare make contact,
it'll blast you off your feet!

293
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:08.390
Yeah? How about I blast it so hard,
it knocks the tip off of Minato Tower?

294
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:09.930
Blast this!

295
00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:41.460
Just like Kamiya said, his hit knocked
down the tip of Minato Tower.

296
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.380
That's the crazy and baffling
Extreme Baseball for you.

297
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.890
Does it take power, skill, or guts?

298
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:56.730
I'm still not sure what's
the deciding factor to win.

299
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.440
But, when I was part of the game...

300
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:04.190
It was so exciting!

301
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.330
Dammit! That Shun Kamiya pisses me off.

302
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.750
Calm down.

303
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.830
Eh? Say what?!

304
00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.670
Oh? If it isn't the wimp, Haru.

305
00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.720
What? You all alone today?

306
00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:29.510
Hmm? What you got there?

307
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:34.470
Eh? What's your deal?

308
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.600
I've decided to try my best!

309
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:50.030
You think I should've gone with him?

310
00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.410
Haru said he'll do it alone, so...

311
00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:56.290
But, still!

312
00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.500
--H-Haru!
--H-Haru!

313
00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.800
--We were worried sick about you!
--I'm glad you're back!
--You all right?!

314
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.630
So? How was it?

315
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.220
Kamiya.

316
00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.520
What's up?

317
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.520
Here.

318
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.400
Keep it, Haru.

319
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.610
Huh?

320
00:23:23.610 --> 00:23:27.650
Aren't you gonna play Extreme Baseball?

321
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.450
Yeah!

322
00:23:31.910 --> 00:23:36.910
Huh? What's that badge?!
What about me?! I want one!

323
00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.500
I dunno about Tuna.

324
00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:42.750
No fair! That's discrimination,
Coffee Barfer!

325
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.420
You sure you wanna insult me?

326
00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.220
--I'm hungry! Make me something!--I just got done making breakfast.
--Can I have some, too?!--Shut up!
